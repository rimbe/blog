# Welcome

Gopher Academy is focused on bringing Gophers together.  Our yearly conference [GopherCon](http://www.gophercon.com) is a great example of our commitment to building a strong and inclusive community around the Go programming language.  As we examined our portfolio, though, it became clear that our blog platform needed some modernization.  We didn't have to look hard to find [hugo](http://gohugo.io), a fast and flexible static site generator written in Go.

## It Takes A Village

As we pondered the move to a new blog platform, the thought of all that work was overwhelming.  But the Gophers in our [slack](http://blog.gopheracademy.com/gophers-slack-community/) channel really stepped up to the challenge.  Steve Francia, Ahsanul Haque, Bill Kennedy, Dave Cheney, and Manuel Ferro were especially active; creating a new blog design, converting the old content to markdown, helping to configure Hugo and working out deployment plans.

## Kick the Tires

Poke around and kick the tires!  We know that there are some loose ends that need to be tied up still, and we're working on fixing them up as we find them.  We hope that the new layout is inviting and easy to navigate.  And we hope that by using Hugo and markdown, we make it easier for community members to contribute content to the blog.  Perhaps you've got an article brewing in the back of your mind and want a platform?  Send us an [email](mailto://social@gopheracademy.com) and we'll help you get it posted.

## Go's 5th Birthday

We're going to put the new blog through its paces this month as we celebrate Go's 5th birthday.  Starting on November 10th, we'll have a month-long series celebrating Go with guest posts from some amazing companies and projects that use Go.  We'll kick it off on Monday with some really big announcements!  See you then.
