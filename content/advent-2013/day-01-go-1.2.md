## Welcome

Welcome to our first Go Advent Calendar.

Gopher Academy is bringing you 25 blog posts about Go in 25 days and we're starting from the top with a blog post from the Go team themselves.

### A new Go release

It's official: Go 1.2 was released this morning.

The Go 1.2 development cycle started with a flurry of commits on the 14th of May. Shortly afterwards Andrew Gerrand posted a [plan for the development cycle](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/WyoohU08z5M/b0zlNIKFBn4J). Learning from the work of releasing Go 1.1, this new cycle was to be less than half as long: barely six months compared to the fourteen month cycle of the previous release.

After 6 months of development, 5 release candidates, close to 1700 commits, and 67 new contributors, Go 1.2 is ready to ship.

The [Go blog has the full announcement](http://blog.golang.org/go12).
