# Registration is now open for the Gopher Gala - the world's first Go distributed hackathon.

You may have heard of the Rails Rumble, Node Knockout, or Django Dash. Now, Go has its own distributed hackathon: the [Gopher Gala](http://gophergala.com).

The Gopher Gala invites people to write a meaningful standalone application using Go over the course of a weekend. It is an online, virtual competition, and participants compete from all over the world. 

After the competition, the community and a panel of judges vote on the apps. Winners receive prizes and the respect of the Go community.

The event will take place January 23-25, starting at 5:00pm PST (which is January 24 at 2:00am UTC), and run for 48 hours. 

People can participate from anywhere in the world, but there will also be in-person events in major cities around the globe, such as New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo.

For more information and to register, check out the [official website](http://gophergala.com/).
